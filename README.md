Let me tell you something, I am lazy. And becasuse of that my Downloads folder is a mess. So I started thinking of ways to automate this chore, and came across the documentation of pathlib and shutil.
The script, in principle, is simple: Take a parent folder (In this case the Downloads folder) and sort its content, based on their file extension. 

  What I learned:
  -Work with file path using the filepath library
  -Use of the shutil library to manipulate files, in this case to move them from one folder to another
  -Schedule task in Windows environment.

Feel free to use, edit and share this script :)
